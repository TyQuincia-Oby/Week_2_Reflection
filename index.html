<h1>Week 2 Reflection</h1> 
<h2>VS Code</h2>
    <p>Installing and touring VS Code was a seamless process. VS Code is essentially a terminal, file navigation and a text editor in one space.</p>
    <p>VS Code allows the developer to open multiple files to flip between.</p>
    <p>The developer can also have multiple terminals open at once where one can run commands, for example pushing/pulling and adding files into the repository</p>
<h2>Emmett</h2>
    <p>Emmet is a tool a developer can use to complete HTML and CSS coding quicker</p>
    <p>{For example, typing "ul>li*3{Red}" then press tab, will create an unordered list with "Red" in a list three times}</p>

<h2>Representing Images</h2>
    <p>In coding, we can use on and off or binary codes to represent images.</p>
    <p>In the image below, the black squares represent 1s (on) and the white 0s (off).</p>

<h2>Binary Code</h2>
    <p>Binary code can represent 1s and 0s, in turn a language a computer can understand.</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Collaborating taught me four things</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Working with others in coding helps you solidfy what you have learned</li>
        <li>Pushing and pulling is a very beneficial way for multiple developers to work on one project</li>
        <li>Have fun applying topics you have learned</li>
        <li>Lastly, conflicts during collaboration will happen but it's important to know how to resolve them</li>
    </ul>
